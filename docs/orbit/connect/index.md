??? example "Example use cases"

    === "Pet and animal information for charities"

        Store pet ownership data alongside donor profiles to personalise communications and segment audiences.
        
        Record attributes such as pet type, pet name, and pet age under **Individuals**. When donors update their information through different channels like website, events, or phone, all sources automatically update the same attributes.
        
    === "Loyalty programme physical characteristics"

        Capture physical characteristics from your loyalty programme data without creating complex table joins. 
        
        Use attributes to store information such as height, eye colour, and clothing size against individual records. This allows your retail team to access and segment customers by these characteristics directly in audience selection, making it easier to personalise product recommendations and targeted offers.
